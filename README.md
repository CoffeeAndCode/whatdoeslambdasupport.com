# What Does Lambda Support

> http://whatdoeslambdasupport.com

An autogenerated static website to show what JavaScript functionality is
supported out of the box with AWS Lambda with node.js.


## Development

This project uses [serverless](http://www.serverless.com) to manage the AWS
Lambda setup and deployment. It's setup as an NPM script that you can run with
a command prefix of `npm run serverless [command] [arguments]`. You will need to
use a newer version of Node to allow the `serverless` application to run any
commands though.

You can run the Lambda function locally with:

```bash
npm run serverless function run generate
```
