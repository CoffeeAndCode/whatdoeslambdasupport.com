> At this point, I'm not sure this project provides much value since many of the es5, es6, js-next, etc features are now commonly found in the Node versions that AWS Lambda supports. The website whatdoeslambdasupport.com has been allowed to expire and this project is no longer being maintained.

# What Does Lambda Support

> http://whatdoeslambdasupport.com

An autogenerated static website to show what JavaScript functionality is
supported out of the box with AWS Lambda with node.js.

For an in depth look at what features are available across the major Node
releases, check out [node.green](http://node.green/) and the
[Kangax compatibility tables](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/).


## Development

This project uses [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to
keep environment variables out of source control. A `.env` file
in the root of the project must have the following:

```bash
S3_WEBSITE_BUCKET=my.bucket.name # s3 bucket to deploy compiled web files to
```

_Note: Make sure to remove any comments from the `.env` file as they
are not supported._

You can test the creation of files using your current version of Node by
running `yarn run test` from the root of the project.


## Deployment

The project uses a [SAM](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model)
template for AWS to setup API endpoints and Lambda functions our
workflow utilizes.

You can deploy the project with `yarn deploy` which will:

- download the latest tests from Kangax compatibility table
- create an S3 bucket specified in `package.json` to hold your deployment artifacts
- prepare a CloudFront changeset template
- initiate the changeset on your behalf

The changeset will create the S3 bucket used to host the web files from. It is
the same bucket specified by `S3_WEBSITE_BUCKET` in the `.env` file.
