# What Does Lambda Support

> http://whatdoeslambdasupport.com

An autogenerated static website to show what JavaScript functionality is
supported out of the box with AWS Lambda with node.js.

For an in depth look at what features are available across the major Node
releases, check out the [Kangax compatibility tables](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/).


## Development

This project uses [serverless](http://www.serverless.com) to manage the AWS
Lambda setup and deployment. It's setup as an NPM script that you can run with
a command prefix of `npm run serverless [command] [arguments]`. You will need to
use a newer version of Node to allow the `serverless` application to run any
commands though.

You can run the Lambda function locally with:

```bash
npm start # an alias for `serverless function run generate`
```

and bring up the Serverless deployment dashboard with:

```bash
npm run deploy # an alias for `serverless dash deploy`
```
